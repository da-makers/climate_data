# climate_data workshop

Acquisition of environmental data using electronic boards: 
- Arduino UNO R3 + DHT 11 sensor
- Arduino NANO 33 BLE Sense
Environmental data of temperature, humidity and brightness were acquired.

|       |        |               | aaverage  | 4   | 8   |

Some tests of the HTS221 (embedded in the NANO board) and DHT11 (wired in the UNO) sensors were done, and discrepancies came out.
